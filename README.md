SensorNet
=========

An experimental wireless sensor network at Vermont Technical College that monitors room
temperatures. This project is used to support the IoT class and the database class, as well as
possibly other projects.

The 'tinyos' folder contains a version for the TinyOS operating system. Other folders supporting
other platforms may appear at a later time.
